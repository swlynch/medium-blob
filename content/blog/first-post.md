Hello! My bio that is permanently pinned to the top of the home page tells you a small amount: I live in Columbus, Ohio and I work for a former-start-up, developing a part of our server code in Rails.

What the biography leaves out for the sake of brevity are some other details that I feel help flesh out what I'm going here:
1. I taught middle school and high school English for ten years, out of college.
2. I worked informally and formally for about five of those years as a teacher trainer, mentor, and, at one point, teaching program director.
3. I graduated from a [very well regarded local coding bootcamp](https://techelevator.com) in December 2017 after a number of years and a childhood of non-impressive coding.
4. This is just my second position as a software engineer, coming out of coding bootcamp.

One common thread that likely will appear in my writing I intend to do here will be the ways that working in a classroom or in a learning environment corrolates with my experiences working in teams, building code. It was often said to me in bootcamp that experiences in previous careers would inform our careers as software developers. I naturally was skeptical of that sentiment, convinced it was a talking point to soothe those of us in the bootcamp about our job prospects. It has only been in the last few few months--a good two years into my career that I see the kinds of ways that my last career have prepared me for writing code with other people.

The caveat I'll add here is that people take the above sentiment--that working in teams of adults is not dissimilar from working with teams of kids--to mean that adults are like children. I would rather flip that assumption and say, rather, that children are more like adults than we give them credit for.

Those points and caveats being made, let's write.
