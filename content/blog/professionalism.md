I have heard this lament a handful of times since working in business: "I just wish So-And-So could be a professional; I don't know why I should have to explain how to be a professional." When I ask the necessary follow up question--"What do you mean by 'being a professional?'"--this is the list I often receive:
- showing up before the time stand-up starts
- being at your desk
- sitting in your seat and do your work

This reminds me of being a teacher and hearing other teachers expasperate about students in our classrooms--"I just wish So-And-So was a good student," etc. When I asked that above-outlined follow-up, their list of what "being a good student" entailed included:
- sitting still
- being quiet
- having a pen or pencil everyday

This invariably brings to mind the completely silent kid who sits there everyday, pen in hand, and does no work, shows no mastery of skills. These lists do not clearly indicate to me someone who is a "good worker" or a "good student"; they, in some cases, describe the behaviors of people who are good at looking productive and, in most cases, describe the lowest tier of behaviors we can expect from each other at work.

What I would propose instead is a list of "professional behaviors" that aim for our greatest potential, assume the best intentions and capabilities and that conversations around how to work center around these more dynamic, complex expectations.

### People Already Know

I had a teaching mentor describe to me one time why she spent little time in her classroom outlining "student behaviors," like the list described above. I paraphrase when I say:

> Kids already know what they should be doing in school. They already know how to school. It's not a surprise by 7th grade that we don't jump on tables or throw things. If they're not able to do those things, it's not because they're not aware of what "doing school" is.

I think the same applies here with anyone in a work environment and for the time being, I am going to assume a very traditional and standard "9-ish to 5-ish" office environment for my examples. I am sure, however, you can mentally map the ideas here to fit other work configurations.

I would be surprised if a young adult, upon starting their first job, would be taken aback that they need arrive by a particular time. Or be doing work. The reasons someone wouldn't "do work" or "do school" are varied: they don't have the resources, they haven't been given feedback on those things, they haven't received consequences for those things, or, often, they are avoiding those things because of low frustration levels, confusion about the work, or so on.

I elide some of the points now so I can turn instead to my central concern: instead of talking about professionalism in terms of hygiene, timeliness, or your ability to stay in your chair, what should a more dynamic and appropriate set of expectations looks like?

### Professionalism, the Glow Up

My belief is that by assuming best intentions and appealing to people's greater capabilities, you spend more time talking and providing feedback to others about important and complex behaviors. A small sample list of these kinds of expectations for professionalism might look read like this:
- We assume best intentions of our colleagues.
- We ask questions out of curiosity to understand other's thinking and assumptions.
- We communicate directly with the people who need to know or might need to know important information.
- We help out others when they are stuck or unable to progress in their work.

This non-exhaustive list assumes that people have the capabilities of being curious, helpful, empathetic, and communicative. Expecting people to be clear communicators, to be able to identify stakeholders, to ask questions to understand is asking them to clear a higher and more powerful bar than "showing up on time." People want to do good work and want to be helpful and, most often, will reach to meet our expectations (given those expecations are fair).

When you say, "we expect you to be at your desk on time and working," that is the minimum you will get out of people. Anything more than that is a bonus. However, if you say, "we expect you to help others," you get the small basic stuff AND the more complex behaviors required in a successful group of people.

### Implications for Organizations

Team standards or expectations are not always as clear as some of those expectations are (if I do say so myself). I imagine organizations struggle to implement language like this because:
- It is difficult work to think through your values and what kinds of behaviors do and do not reflect those values.
- We have a culture that places a value on currency and countable things; we do not have a cultural ease or facility with the intangible.
- It is challenging to know how to give feedback and constructive tools for people struggling with those "higher-class" behaviors.

As is often said, just because something is difficult doesn't mean it shouldn't be done. And given the potential for people to work more thoughtfully with one another--and given the need for us to expect more from each other with the complexity of the tasks we have--it is necessary for any organization looking to fulfill its workforce's potential.
